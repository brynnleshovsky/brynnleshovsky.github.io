		<h3 class = "aboutme">Hi! I'm Brynn leshovsky and I am the creator of this website! I made this website for my web page design class. I am a junior in highschool and I chose to do my final project on plants. I have a love for plants that started when I was very young. The picture on the left was from seventh grade! I currently have a collection of around 20 plants. I have been every type of plant parent, from over watering, to maybe watering every two weeks if they're lucky, and now to having a plethora of knowlege about plants. I enjoy both housepplants and plants out in nature. I first started my plant collection during the winter of 2020. My very first plant purchase is still alive: my pothos named Neville :). This website was created using html, css, and a little bit of java script. I know my website will be effective because I've watched as my plants thrive or die under my changing styles of care. Enjoy!</h3>
