		<hr>
	  <p class = "font">According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 36.42 square miles (94.33 km2); 32.73 square miles (84.77 km2) is land and 3.69 square miles (9.56 km2) is water.[8]</p>

<p class = "font">The Crow River flows along the city's eastern boundary, separating it from the city of Rogers in Hennepin County. It also borders Monticello Township, Buffalo Township, Rockford Township, and the cities of Otsego and Albertville, all in Wright County, as well as the city of Hanover, which is located within both Wright and Hennepin counties.</p>

	  <p class = "font">Interstate 94, US Highway 52, and Minnesota State Highway 241 are three of the main routes in the city.</p>
		
		
		
		<h2 class = "font2">History</h2>
		<hr>
	  <p class = "font">A post office called St. Michael has been in operation since 1858.[9] The city took its name from St. Michael Roman Catholic Church.[10] St. Michael was incorporated in 1890.[10] The Corner Bar, a restaurant in service since 1897, was on 10 Main Street South downtown which shut down January 9, 2020 and was razed on Friday, August 14, 2020. Generational patrons drove by and many stopped to collect a brick or two to commemorate the end of this era. Oddly enough the founding father of Ditto's Bar, down the street from the Corner Bar, also left this earth days later while the name and establishment still live on in Main Street.[11] A complete history of the city, ‘’Faith, Family and Farming’’, was written by Bob Zahler.[12] The history is also tracked by the St. Michael Historical Society, whose mission is "to collect, preserve and share the history of the City of St. Michael."[13]</p>
