I won't bore you with more tips, but I will offer a couple of ways to make your garden cuter! I got these <a class = "links3" href = "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/plant-animals-npw/1140546535?ean=0810064772047">animals</a> from Barnes and Noble to hang on my plants. They are super fun and i get a lot of compliments on them! Another thing you can do is to add little <a class = "links3" href = "https://www.amazon.com/Pieces-Markers-Wooden-Markers-Vegetable-Flowers/dp/B08X63ZPQ1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2SY2W3SWTTNCC&keywords=funny+plant+tags&qid=1654102055&sprefix=funny+%2Caps%2C63&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExUU9UQzRYVDFEQkYwJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzMzMjY1M1NGWVA3SUVSUEw0USZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzAyMDk1UlFGNDkxTUpSVVhQJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==">plant tags</a>. You ca buy them from that link, or you could take that as inspiration and make your own for cheap! Either way they will not fail to enhance your already beautiful collection. I've created a list of exotic house plants that you (hopefully!!) haven't hear of before. Be warned: Most of these will cost you a pretty penny and it might cost you a few years of your life to find them! Happy planting!</h3>
