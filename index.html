		<p>I'm Brynn and here's a little bit about me. I'm seventeen years old and I'm a junior in highschool. I have two cats and I live in Minnesota. I have 15 plants right now :) Apart from taking care of plants, I enjoy reading and crocheting. I also like running, but only when it's warm outside. </p></div>
